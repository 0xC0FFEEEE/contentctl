# Introduction
#### Security Is Hard 
Anyone who has managed a [SOC](acronym) will tell you it's hard work.  SOC Managers, Detection Engineers, and Cybersecurity Professionals must understand and manage countless tools and data sources while ensuring the reliability and security of their network and applications.  At the same time, they must be able to detect and react to data breeches, vulnerabilities, and performance degradation in minutes - not seconds or hours.
These responsibilities leave little time for writing new content - let alone documentation, maintenance, and testing of legacy content.  Existing solutions like Wikis, JIRA tickets, Excel Spreadsheets, and "asking that one team member who knows everything" don't scale and spread information across various systems.       
#### contentctl Makes It ~~Easy~~ Less Hard 
contentctl is a single application that support the full cycle of security content development (each of the links below will redirect to the appropriate section of the README/Wiki):

- [Create Content Packs](contentctl-init) - Version-Controlled collections of searches, documentation, and test data
- [Add New Content](contentctl-new-content) - searches, macros, lookups, and other content
- [Statically Validate](contentctl-validate) Content Against a Well-Defined Baseline
- [Building](contentctl-build) a Content Pack for your target - Use a supported output format or design your own
- [Generate](contentctl-generate) documentation, MITRE Maps, and a website that makes your Content Pack searchable and easy to understand  
- [Test](contentctl-test) your Content Pack on a running Splunk Instance
- [Deploy](contentctl-deploy) your Content Pack to Splunk Cloud Instance, via REST API, or create a Splunkbase Application for manual deployment

| [PurpleSharp Attack Simulation](https://github.com/mvelazc0/PurpleSharp) | Open source adversary simulation tool for Windows Active Directory environments (integrated into Attack Range)|
| [Red Canary Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team)          | Library of attack simulations mapped to the MITRE ATT&CKÂ® framework (integrated into Attack Range)|
| [Splunk Attack Data](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data)          | Repository of Attack Simulation Data for writing and Testing Detections|                         |
| [Splunk Security Content](https://github.com/splunk/security_content)          | Splunk Threat Research Team's Content included in the [Enterprise Security Content Update App (ESCU)](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3449)|
| [Splunk contentctl](https://github.com/splunk/contentctl)          | Generate, validate, build, test, and deploy custom Security Content|

## Installation
### Requirements
| Requirement | Required | Description | 
| --------------------- | ----- | ---- |
| Python <3.9 | Not Supported | No support planned.  contentctl tool uses modern language constructs not supported ion Python3.8 and below |
| Python 3.9 | Required | contentctl tool is written in Python |
| Python 3.10 | Not Supported (yet) | Will be supported |
| Python 3.11 | Not Supported (yet) | Will be supported |
| Docker (local or remote) | Recommended | A running Splunk Server is required for Dynamic Testing.  contentctl can automatically create, configure, and destroy this server as a Splunk container during the lifetime of a test.  This is the easiest, and recommended, testing method.  Alternatively, you may specify the address and credentials for a preconfigured server for testing or choose to skip dynamic testing. Please see the page [Dynamic Testing with Docker](testingWithDocker) for important information about performance on macOS |



**Because contentctl uses a large number of dependencies, it's recommended to install it in a virtual environment. The instructions below follow this recommendation.**

#### Install via pip (recommended): 
```
python3.9 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install splunk-contentctl
```

#### From Source (advanced)
```
git clone git@github.com:splunk/contentctl.git
cd contentctl
python3.9 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install poetry
poetry install
poetry shell
contentctl --help
```


# Usage

## contentctl init
## 

1. **init** - Initilialize a new repo from scratch so you can easily add your own content to a custom application. 
2. **new** - Creates new content (detection, story)
3. **validate** - Validates written content
4. **build** - Builds an application suitable for deployment on a search head using Slim, the Splunk Packaging Toolkit
5. **deploy** - Deploy the security content pack to a Splunk Server
6. **docs** - Create documentation as Markdown
7. **reporting** - Create different reporting files such as a Mitre ATT&CK overlay
